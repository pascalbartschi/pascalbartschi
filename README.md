Welcome to my GitHub profile! I will persue my Masters degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) and working on a research paper about symmetric hysteresis dynamics in the department for Evolutionary Biology of UZH (University of Zurich). I'm passionate about applying computational methods and data analysis techniques to understand biological systems.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- Computational Biology
- Systems Biology
- Bioinformatics
- Data Analysis
- Mathematical Modeling in Biology

## 📝 Current Project: Symmetry Hysteresis Research

I am currently working on a research paper titled "Hysteresis in symmetric ecosysterms" as part of my studies at ETH. The aim of this project is to investigate the presence and implications of symmetry hysteresis in biological processes, such as developmental systems or ecological interactions. I am utilizing computational tools and mathematical modeling to analyze and simulate these phenomena.
